# PROJECT NAME: Building-Core-Sign-Up-Functions-to-Help-Validate-New-Users

## Project Description
In this project, I will write reusable Python functions to standardize validation checks for new user sign-ups in a mobile app. My code will reduce invalid and incomplete sign-up attempts crashing the app.  

# INSTRUCTIONS
1.Implement a function called validate_name(), that takes in one parameter, which will be a datatype of string to check the user has inputted a valid name. The function should check that the user has inputted a name that is a data type of string. The function should check that the name is greater than two characters long. The function should return a boolean value, True if the name is valid, and False if not.

2.Implement a function called validate_email(), that takes in one parameter, which will be a datatype of string to check the user has inputted a valid email. The function should check that the user has inputted an email that contains an '@' symbol. The function should check that the email contains any top-level domain included in the top_level_domains list variable. This has been preloaded to the workbook for you. The function should return a boolean value,True if the name is valid, and False if not.
